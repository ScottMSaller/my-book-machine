  ## Description
  My Book Machine is a project that uses React, Node.js, Css, Html, and JavaScript. The project allows a user to search a seemingly endless library of books thanks to the Google Books Api. Any User can sign up and create an account and save any books that that they would like to read later, or simply add to their list. The saving books and account management is thanks to the use of GraphQL and MongoDB. The backend is powered by Express.js and Apollo Server.
